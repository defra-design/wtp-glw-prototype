      Dear Customer,
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-heading-m">
      There's a new online service for green list waste exporters.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Green list waste is non-hazardous, uncontaminated, single-stream waste like paper or scrap metal. It can be exported overseas for recovery under Article 18 controls.
    </p>
    
    <p class="govuk-heading-s">
      Who we are
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We are the agency, the governmentâ€™s environmental regulator.  We regulate waste management for the 
      protection of people and the environment.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-heading-s">
      Why we have emailed you
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We have sent you this email because you are involved in waste imports or exports.
    </p>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Telling us about green list waste exports in advance will become a legal requirement 
      from 1 April 2023, but you can start using the service today.
